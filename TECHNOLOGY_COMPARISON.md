2. **Windows Live Wallpaper** - Complex Windows API integration
3. **Sprite Performance** - Need to validate 60fps on lower-end Android tablets

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Early Prototyping** - Build proof of concepts for risky components first
2. **Performance Testing** - Regular testing on target Android devices
3. **Fallback Plans** - Alternative approaches for each high-risk area
4. **Community Support** - Leverage existing examples and plugins where possible

## Performance Expectations

### Target Performance Metrics
- **Web:** 60fps with 50+ animated sprites
- **Android:** 30-60fps with 30+ animated sprites (device dependent)
- **Windows:** 60fps with 100+ animated sprites
- **Memory Usage:** <500MB on Android, <1GB on Windows
- **Load Time:** <3 seconds initial load, <1 second module loading

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Sprite Atlasing** - Combine textures to reduce draw calls
2. **Object Pooling** - Reuse sprite objects to reduce garbage collection
3. **LOD System** - Use different sprite resolutions based on device capabilities
4. **Lazy Loading** - Load modules and assets on demand
5. **Culling** - Only render visible sprites
